talk_abstract: In this session, I will give a talk about the use of Python in the geoscientific subject. I will mention some of the actual practices in the industries and researches. I would also like to show the audience (geoscientists) the ability of Python to help their daily tasks. For example, to overcome the limitation of their currently owned software to perform other possible options for specific analysis or even performing analysis that they havenâ€™t had the software yet. I will share several examples from my previous works.
